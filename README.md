# Yearn-Abracadabra-Auto-Lending-and-Staking-Dapp

This is a defi and tradfi lending protocol with a backend that functions with defi-strategies but lends in the real world to real businesses and investors who need FIAT for their own investments. 
When the client deposits FIAT, they are  granted a yield-bearing token as a representation of their deposit and its future yield as an “ibToken” or interest-bearing token.
Users are able to withdraw these ibTokens from the initial protocol and deposit them into another protocol, to leverage and borrow against them.

This is done on; Alchemix, Abracadabra and Yearn lending platforms. This version will run on the Ethereum blockchain
